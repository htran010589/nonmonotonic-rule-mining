abstract = "Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a new discipline which investigates the inductive construction of first-order clausal theories from examples and background knowledge. We survey the most important theories and methods of this new field. First, various problem specifications of ILP are formalized in semantic settings for ILP, yielding a “model-theory” for ILP. Second, a generic ILP algorithm is presented. Third, the inference rules and corresponding operators used in ILP are presented, resulting in a “proof-theory” for ILP. Fourth, since inductive inference does not produce statements which are assured to follow from what is given, inductive inferences require an alternative form of justification. This can take the form of either probabilistic support or logical constraints on the hypothesis language. Information compression techniques used within ILP are presented within a unifying Bayesian approach to confirmation and corroboration of hypotheses. Also, different ways to constrain the hypothesis language or specify the declarative bias are presented. Fifth, some advanced topics in ILP are addressed. These include aspects of computational learning theory as applied to ILP, and the issue of predicate invention. Finally, we survey some applications and implementations of ILP. ILP applications fall under two different categories: first, scientific discovery and knowledge acquisition, and second, programming assistants."

abstract="Recent advances in information extraction have led to huge knowledge bases (KBs), which capture knowledge in a machine-readable format. Inductive logic programming (ILP) can be used to mine logical rules from these KBs, such as ``If two persons are married, then they (usually) live in the same city.'' While ILP is a mature field, mining logical rules from KBs is difficult, because KBs make an open-world assumption. This means that absent information cannot be taken as counterexamples. Our approach AMIE (Gal{\'a}rraga et al. in WWW, 2013) has shown how rules can be mined effectively from KBs even in the absence of counterexamples. In this paper, we show how this approach can be optimized to mine even larger KBs with more than 12M statements. Extensive experiments show how our new approach, AMIE                                                                          {\$}{\$}+{\$}{\$}                                                            +                                                      , extends to areas of mining that were previously beyond reach.",
