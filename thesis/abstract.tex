These days witness the development of information extraction, which leads to the birth of knowledge graphs (KGs), that is, large collections of relational facts. Though information extraction tools can be executed automatically, it is not guaranteed that the KGs they produce are complete. Hence, Open World Assumption (OWA) should be applied to these graphs, that is, facts which are not given can be treated as true or false. Rule mining approaches can be applied to tackle the problem of KG completion. Nonetheless, the existing approaches pay attention to positive rules, which do not take exceptions or negated atoms into consideration and may therefore infer wrong facts. Recently a rule-based technique that bridges this gap has been proposed, but it only works on flattened presentation of a KG, that is, a collection of unary facts. This work extends the previous results and presents an approach for mining exception enriched rules over KGs in their original relational form. The contributions of this thesis are:

\begin{itemize}
\item We introduce a framework to revise positive rules and improve quality of KGs.
\item From given KG and a set of positive rules, we propose a method for finding exception candidates, assessing their quality and ranking them based on chosen measure with a novel concept of partial materialization.
\item We implement a system and conduct experiments to test our methodology and they demonstrate promising results.

\end{itemize}
