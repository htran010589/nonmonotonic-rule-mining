Recent advances in information extraction have led to the so-called knowledge graphs (KGs), i.e., huge collections of relational facts treated under the Open World Assumption (OWA), e.g., DBPedia, YAGO and Wikidata. As such KGs are automatically constructed, they are often erroneous and incomplete. 
To address these issues, data mining techniques have been exploited to infer Horn rules, which however, are insufficiently 
expressive to capture exceptions, and might thus make incorrect predictions on missing facts. 
Recently, a rule-based method for filling in this gap was proposed. 
It takes into account a cross-talk between the Horn rules and aims at revising 
them by adding exceptions to obtain a ruleset that describes the observed data 
well and predicts the unseen data consistently. However, it applies only to a 
flattened representation of a KG. In this work we make the first steps towards 
extending this approach to KGs in their original relational form, and provide 
preliminary evaluation results on a real world KG, which demonstrate effectiveness of our method.
