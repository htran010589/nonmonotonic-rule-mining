These days witness the development of information extraction, which leads to the birth of knowledge graphs (KGs), that is, big data of relational facts. Though information extraction tools can be executed automatically, it is not guaranteed that KGs can be complete, hence, Open World Assumption (OWA) should be applied to these graphs. Rule mining approaches are solutions to tackle the problem of KG completion. Nonetheless, these solutions pay attention to positive rules, which do not take exceptions or negated atoms into consideration and may infer wrong unseen data. There is a rule-based technique trying to solve this issue, but it only works on flattened presentation of KG, that is, a collection of unary projected facts. This work takes care about KG in a nature format - the first extension to the original form of binary facts.

The contributions of this thesis are: i) we introduce a theory revision framework to capture negated atoms, this is a rule-based method for KG completion problem, ii) we propose a method for finding exception candidates, assessing their quality and ranking them based on choosen measure, iii) we conduct experiments to test the above-mentioned methodology.
