\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:concl}
We have presented a method for mining nonmonotonic rules from KGs: first learning a set of Horn rules  and
then revising them by adding negated atoms into their bodies with the goal of
improving the quality of a rule set for data prediction.
To select the best
revision from potential candidates we devised rule-set ranking
measures, based on data mining measures and the novel
concept of partial materialization.
We evaluated our method with various
configurations on both general-purpose and domain-specific KGs and observed significant
improvements over a baseline Horn rule mining.

There are various directions for future work. First, we look
into extracting evidence for or against exceptions from
text and web corpora.
 Second, our framework
can be enhanced by partial completeness assumptions
for certain
predicates (e.g., all countries are available in KG) or constants (e.g.,
knowledge about Barack Obama is complete).
Finally, an overriding future direction is to extend our
work to more complex nonmonotonic rules, with
higher-arity predicates, aggregates and disjunctions in
rule heads.
