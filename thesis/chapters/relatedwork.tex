\chapter{Related Work}

The area of rule mining on knowledge graphs has attracted interests from many researchers recently. This problem can be classified into two main directions: statistics-based and logic-based approaches.

\section{Statistics-based Approach}

This approach focuses on building models with latent features which are not directly observable from the original data~\cite{ref1}.

\section{Logic-based Approach}

\subsection{ILP-based System}

Rule mining is a core problem in ILP-based system, however, there are two issues:

\begin{itemize}
	\item ILP system is not scalable for big data.
	\item ILP system always requires positive and negative examples while in our problem, only positive observations are given.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AMIE+ System}

AMIE and AMIE+ are created to tackle the above-mentioned problems, but they only take care about positive rules.

\subsection{Nonmonotonic Rule Mining System}

This work is an extension from a non mototonic rule mining system (ISWC paper). The previous work focuses on flattened data while the current one treat the knowlege graph in the nature format.
