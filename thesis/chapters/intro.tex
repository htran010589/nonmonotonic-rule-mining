\label{chap:intro}

These days witness the development of information extraction techniques which enable us to generate many facts in machine-readable format. However, these facts may be not complete and erroneous. To tackle this, Data Mining is applied to generate Horn rules. The advantages from this work are two-fold, that is, we can expand new facts and cleaning the original data.

\section{Motivation}

Positive rules generated from state-of-the-art system are not enough for describing or predicting facts. Indeed, they need to be revised and exceptions should be added to the body of the rules to cover more facts. That is the reason why we should take nonmonotonic rules into consideration.
