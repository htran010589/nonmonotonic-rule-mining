\section{Motivation}
\label{chap:motivation}

These days witness the development of information extraction methods, which are fruitfully exploited for automatic construction of KGs, that is, large collection of relational facts with the RDF~\cite{ref38} format $\langle subject \rangle \langle predicate \rangle \langle object \rangle$. These are triples reflecting facts about the real world which can be converted to facts over unary and binary relations in predicate calculus. Indeed, the unary, binary relations are corresponding to the RDF fact with $\langle type \rangle$ and other predicates, respectively. For example, $\langle Brad \rangle \langle livesIn \rangle \langle Berlin \rangle$ can be rewritten as $livesIn(Brad, Berlin)$ while $\langle Mat \rangle \langle type \rangle \langle artist \rangle$ can be converted to $artist(Mat)$. Examples of KGs include the YAGO~\cite{ref28}, FreeBase~\footnote{\url{https://developers.google.com/freebase/}}, etc (see Chapter~\ref{chap:relwork} for details).

KGs are normally incomplete due to automatic construction. Hence, they should be processed under the Open World Assumption (OWA). The \textit{knowledge completion problem} (also known as \textit{link prediction}) plays an important role in improving the quality of KGs. To achieve this, rule learning approaches~\cite{ref39, ref10} are used to create rules which can infer new potentially missing facts. However, the existing methods only pay attention to positive rules, which do not take exceptions (negated atoms) into consideration and may therefore infer wrong facts. For instance, a rule:

\begin{center}
$r1: livesIn(Y,Z) \leftarrow isMarriedTo(X,Y), livesIn(X,Z)$
\end{center}

can be discovered from the graph in Figure~\ref{fig1.1} and exploited to predict new facts $livesIn(Alice, Berlin), livesIn(Dave, Chicago)$ and $livesIn(Lucy, Amsterdam)$. It can be seen that the first two facts might be incorrect because $Alice$ and $Dave$ are researchers and the rule $r1$ might have researcher as an exception. Mining exceptions should be taken into account to improve the rule quality and subsequently the quality of facts it produces.

\section{Challenges}

Exception mining problem has been addressed in the problem of \textit{nonmonotonic rule learning}~\cite{ref11, ref40, ref41, ref32, ref42}. However, the state-of-the-art nonmonotonic ILP algorithms cannot be directly applied to our problem due to the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item First, the \textit{target relations} are hard to clearly indicated because we do not know which parts of the graph need to be extended. A naive solution to this issue is to mine all possible rules for the available predicates in the KG. However, this solution is computationally expensive due to the large number of facts in the original KGs.
\item Second, \textit{negative facts} are difficult to collect because we sometimes cannot differentiate between wrong and unseen triples and there are a lot of facts in KGs. Thus, a simple approach to overcome this is to discover rules from solely positive facts.
\item Finally, the \textit{language bias} is not easy to define since the schema of the original data is not given. To tackle this, we assume the specific form of the positive rules in Chapter~\ref{chap:system}.
\end{itemize}

To overcome the above obstacles, exploratory data mining solution is a suitable choice. The authors in~\cite{ref12} propose association rule mining methods to explore Horn positive rules, and then revise them by inserting exceptions or negated atoms in their body to improve the predictive quality of the rules. However, this approach only works on flattened presentation of a KG, that is, a collection of unary facts.

\section{Goals}

\section{Contributions}

This thesis is an extension of the work to KGs in their natural form~\cite{ref12}. More specifically, we want to mine rules with exceptions from a set of relational facts treated under OWA of KGs. The knowledge completion problem is transformed to \textit{theory revision} one, in which \textit{nonmonotonic rules} are explored given an original KG and Horn rules. The positive rules can be found by using off-the-shell tools for association rule learning. Besides, we expect that the quality of revised rules is better than that of original positive ones with respect to a specific measure.

There are four steps in our system. First, for each positive rule, we try to find normal and abnormal sets, that is, set of instances that follow and do not follow a given rule, respectively. Second, we mine exception witness sets, that is, set of unary or binary relations that can eliminate abnormal instances. For example, \textit{Researcher} is an example for this in Figure~\ref{fig1.1}. Thirdly, we add exceptions to the Horn rules and define a measure to assess the quality. Besides, the interaction between revised rules taken into consideration by a novel concept of \textit{partial materialization}. Finally, exceptions are ranked based on the proposed measures and the revised rules are expected to have both descriptive and predictive qualities.

The contributions of this thesis are three-fold:

\begin{itemize}
\item We introduce a theory revision framework to capture negated atoms, this is a rule-based method for KG completion problem.
\item We propose a method for finding exception candidates, assessing their quality and ranking them based on choosen measure. Especially with the novel concept of \textit{partial materialization}, the cross-talk between the revised rules are concerned.
\item We conduct experiments with YAGO3 and IMDB datasets to test the above-mentioned methodology and partial materialization concept.
\end{itemize}
